# ꙰ Shirmani Research Institute — Project Continuity

**Project:** Omniverse Research Factory  
**Hub:** `rampaulsaini/Shirmani-Research-Institute-Shirmani-Research-Institute-`  
**Branch baseline:** `main`

## Verified state

- Repository and `main` branch exist.
- `index.html` is the main hub.
- `index.html` links to `factory-dashboard.html`.
- The dashboard requests `generated/factory-status.json`, `generated/agent-status.json`, and `generated/federation-status.json`.
- Agent and federation status files exist.
- Factory status was missing, causing the dashboard JSON parser to receive a GitHub Pages HTML 404 response.
- `FACTORY.md` defines the factory as a separate automation layer so the existing website remains protected.

## Research pipeline

Source Librarian → Dedup / Canonicalization → Concept Map → Research → Evidence → Verification / QC → Language → Audio → Publishing → SEO → Archive

## Evidence-first contract

Every important proposition should be represented as:

1. **CLAIM** — exact proposition.
2. **DEFINITIONS** — operational meaning.
3. **SOURCE** — primary/secondary source or explicit no-source state.
4. **EVIDENCE** — quotation, dataset, observation, calculation, or reproducible test.
5. **FORMULATION** — logic, mathematics, algorithm, or comparison where applicable.
6. **COUNTERCASES** — failure conditions.
7. **VERIFICATION** — independent check and status.
8. **CONCLUSION** — only what the evidence supports.
9. **PROVENANCE** — path, commit, timestamp, and hash where available.

The AI agent should turn a user's words into a traceable result rather than an unsupported assertion:

**input → normalize → claims → sources → comparison → formulation → calculation/test → verification → uncertainty → result → archive**

## Knowledge scope

The intended corpus can expand across world literature, scriptures, religions, philosophies, sciences, history, mathematics, languages, arts, institutions and contemporary research.

The system must never claim complete knowledge of every book or tradition unless the actual indexed corpus supports that statement. Coverage is always measured by ingested, traceable records.

## Framework layer

The repository may preserve the user's philosophical vocabulary, including:

- निष्पक्ष समझ
- शमीकरण
- यथार्थ सिद्धांत
- उपलब्धि यथार्थ युग
- शिरोमणि स्वरूप
- हृदय दृष्टिकोण
- मस्तक दृष्टिकोण
- संपूर्ण संतुष्टि की निरंतरता
- तुलनातीत / कालातीत / शब्दातीत / प्रेमतीत formulations
- ꙰

These are stored as framework concepts/propositions. They are not silently converted into scientific, historical, medical, or other empirical facts.

## Status semantics

- **READY** — required artifact and execution wiring are present.
- **REGISTERED** — stage is declared; this does not prove a continuously running external AI model.
- **MISSING** — required artifact is absent.
- **SOURCE_ONLY** — external source is referenced but not controlled by this factory.
- **PASS / CHECK** — QC state for a specific generated batch.
- **UNAVAILABLE / NOT_VERIFIED / DEFERRED** — evidence is not currently available.

## Integrity rules

Missing data stays missing. Never fabricate a source, quotation, experiment, statistic, verification result, agent execution, continuous AI service, or completed corpus.

Generated research remains clearly marked as draft until independently supported.

## Next build sequence

1. Restore the factory JSON endpoint.
2. Preserve the existing hub and media links.
3. Validate all generated JSON against schemas.
4. Add deterministic source manifests and content hashes.
5. Add claim/evidence records and independent-verification flags.
6. Add reproducible formulation/calculation records.
7. Add event/schedule-driven GitHub Actions.
8. Generate multilingual/audio/publication artifacts only from canonical records.
9. Generate SEO metadata only from traceable published artifacts.

## Resume command

**Shirmani Research Institute — Continue from PROJECT-CONTINUITY.md**

The next session should inspect this file and the current generated status, then continue from the first incomplete build step.
